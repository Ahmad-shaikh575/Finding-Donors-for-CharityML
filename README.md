# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML
This project contains a ipython jupyter notebook of my jupyter project part of my udacity nanodegree.
I have selected and trained a model for predicting the salary of individuals given many features
This was a binary classification problem
The outcome was is the salary of individual is <=50K or >50K

#Uses
It could be helpful to send the application of donation only to those customers who earn more than 50K.
This have a better probabiltiy of donating.
