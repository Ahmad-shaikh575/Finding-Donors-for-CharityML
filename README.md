# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML
This project contains an ipython jupyter notebook of my jupyter project part of my udacity nanodegree.
I have selected and trained a model for predicting the salary of individuals given many features
This was a binary classification problem
The outcome was is the salary of individual is <=50K or >50K

# Model Used
I have tried three classification models
1. SVM
2. Gaussian Bayes Theoram
3. AdaBoost Classifier

The best one was AdaBoost as it had highest accurancy and F-score.
# Conclusion
It could be helpful to send the application of donation only to those customers who earn more than 50K.
This have a better probabiltiy of donating.
